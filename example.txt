Please download the docker image use: 

docker push rg15/deeplung:0.3

after download docker image: 

rg15/deeplung:0.3

One example to run is: 

sudo docker run -u root -v /your/local/INPUTS:/INPUTS/ -v /your/local/OUTPUTS:/OUTPUTS deeplung:0.3 sh run_all.sh

I will share a INPUTS example that can run via vanderbilt box shortly. 

The path: 

the local input path: 

/your/local/INPUTS

The local output path: 

/your/local/OUTPUTS

You can change the local input / output paths as you want. 

In my local input path:

a csv file: "test.csv" includes the scans you want test and the meta data information. 

a fold: "NIfTI" stores the image you want to process. 

The output path will generate: 

a fold: "prep" stores the preprocessed image from the original nifti.

a fold: "bbox" stores the detected lung nodule location. 

a fold: "feat" stores the image feature extreated from nifti. 

a csv file "pred.csv" stores the predicted cancer probability (not calibrated).
